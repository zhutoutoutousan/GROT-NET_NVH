abstract="Present order tracking methods for solving noise and vibration problems are reviewed, both FFT and re-sampling based order tracking methods. The time variant discrete Fourier transform (TVDFT) is developed as an alternative order tracking method. This method contains many advantages which the current order tracking methods do not possess. This method has the advantage of being very computationally efficient as well as the ability to minimize leakage errors. The basic TVDFT method may also be extended to a more complex method through the use of an orthogonality compensation matrix (OCM) which can separate closely spaced orders as well as separate the contributions of crossing orders. The basic TVDFT is a combination of the FFT and the re-sampling based methods. This method can be formulated in several different manners, one of which will give results matching the re-sampling based methods very closely. Both analytical and experimental data are used to establish the behavioral characteristics of this new method.",

  abstract = 	 {While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausible than hyperbolic tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks. This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.

  abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful generative models, but suffer from training instability. The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes significant progress toward stable training of GANs, but can still generate low-quality samples or fail to converge in some settings. We find that these training failures are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to pathological behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the gradient norm of the critic wrt its input. Our proposed method converges faster, generates higher-quality samples than WGAN with weight clipping, and enables very stable GAN training: for the first time, we can train a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models over discrete data. We further demonstrate state of the art inception scores on CIFAR-10, and provide samples on higher resolution datasets.}

abstract = {Order tracking is considered as a classic and effective technique of the non-stationary vibration analysis for rotating machinery. Traditionally, a tachometer is required to obtain a reference signal. Some tacho-less order tracking methods have been proposed in the past few years to improve the applicability of traditional order tracking technique. However, current tacho-less order tracking methods are only applicable to those with small speed fluctuations. A new tacho-less order tracking method is established for any speed variations including large speed variation such as run-up or run-down process of machinery. In this method, a Chirplet-based approach is proposed to estimate the instantaneous frequency of a certain harmonic of rotating frequency. The result is accurate and reliable since the chirp basis can be adjusted to match the vibration signal. After that, Vold–Kalman filter is employed to extract the harmonic, because it is particularly suitable for the harmonic extraction under large speed variations. Then, the shaft angular position is recovered from the vibration signal through demodulating the extracted harmonic. The order tracking is carried out by using the shaft angular position thereafter. Simulations and experiments are given to testify the proposed tacho-less method. The results obtained by the proposed method are almost the same as those obtained by a tachometer under large speed variation.}

abstract = {Chirplet transform (CT) has been widely used in time–frequency analysis (TFA) of rotating machinery vibration signals. However, due to the smear effect and time–frequency resolution limitation, CT and most of its improved algorithms cannot achieve sufficient refined time–frequency representation (TFR) for the instantaneous frequency (IF) close-spaced and IF trajectory slope mutation signals. Aiming at the aforementioned shortcomings, a novel TFA method named slope synchronous chirplet transform (SSCT) is proposed to address this problem. The proposed SSCT algorithm can adaptively adjust the window lengths according to the slope variation of the IF trajectory, thereby higher time–frequency resolution can be obtained for the IF close-spaced components. Besides, the proposed method utilizes a high-order phase operator to accurately capture the trend of IF trajectory slope, so that the time–frequency (TF) energy of the IF trajectory can be better concentrated, thereby the weak TF energy of the IF trajectory can be uncovered. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulated signals and an aero-engine vibration signal measured under a transient operating mode, the validation results indicate the proposed method outperforms some latest reported TFA algorithms and is available for accurate estimation of instantaneous angular speed for tacho-less order tracking of rotating machineries.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {Order tracking has been considered as the most effective non-stationary signal analysis technique for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Conventional order tracking is performed with a reference signal measured by the auxiliary device, which is expensive and inconvenient to install. In order to to break the constraint of the traditional order tracking technique, some tacholess order tracking methods have been developed in the past few years. However, current tacholess order tracking approaches are only applicable to slightly varying speed applications. To overcome the shortcoming above, a novel tacholess order tracking method is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, each mode of the vibration signal is reconstructed by a method called extended intrinsic chirp component decomposition, and the Hilbert transform is used to estimate the instantaneous phase of reference shaft. Then the vibration signal is resampled to the angle domain, and the fault characteristic orders can be identified in the order spectrum accurately. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by a simulated meshing gear vibration signal. The result illustrates that the proposed method can realize gears fault diagnosis under large speed variation conditions.}

ABSTRACT = {Order tracking has been widely used to diagnose failures of variable speed rotating machines. The performance of the TOT (Time-Frequency Domain Tacholess Order Tracking) methods is based on the correct separation of the target component strictly related to the shaft rotation frequency. Currently, most of the methods have focused on obtaining the instantaneous frequency with accuracy. In this paper, a new TOT method has been proposed that combines the inverse short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT) with singular value decomposition (SVD). The target component closely related to the shaft rotation frequency is selected and filtered approximately in the time-frequency domain. Hence, the ISTFT is adopted to reverse the target component into the time domain. Next, SVD is used to refine the roughly filtered target component. Finally, the phase of the refined signal is extracted to resample the original signal. The performance of the method was tested using real vibration signals collected from a large-scale test rig of a high-speed train traction system.},
